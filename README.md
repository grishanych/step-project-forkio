### Git flow

- **Option 2**

  - create new branch from development branch

  #### Step 2

- add some code to your new branch

#### Step 3

- Run git add . in the terminal. This will track any changes made to the folder on your system, since the last commit. As this is the first time you are committing the contents of the folder, it will add everything

#### Step 4

- Run git commit -m"insert Message here". This will prepare the added/tracked changes to the folder on your system for pushing to Github. Here, insert Message here can be replaced with any relevant commit message of your choice.

#### Step 5

- Run git push origin ‚Äúbranch_name‚Äù. Note that the last word in the command ‚Äúbranch_name‚Äù, is not a fixed entry when running git push. It can be replaced with any relevant ‚Äúbranch_name‚Äù.
